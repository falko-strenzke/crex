//! Records how this binary was built, for the menu's "Version" entry
//! (`src/version.rs` turns the three variables into the displayed text):
//!
//! * `BUILD_TAG` — the git tag HEAD sits exactly on, if any. Its presence is
//!   what makes a build an *official*, versioned one.
//! * `BUILD_COMMIT` — the abbreviated commit HEAD points at, which identifies
//!   every other ("general") build.
//! * `BUILD_MODIFIED` — non-empty when the working tree had uncommitted
//!   changes, so a build that does not match its commit says so.
//!
//! All three are empty when git is unavailable or the source is not a
//! checkout (a release tarball, a vendored copy); the version text falls back
//! to the package version alone.
