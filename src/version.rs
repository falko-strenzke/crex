//! How this binary identifies itself — the menu's "About ▸ Version" entry.
//!
//! Two kinds of build are distinguished, from what `build.rs` recorded:
//!
//! * An **official** build is one made from a commit carrying a git tag, with
//!   nothing modified on top of it. It is identified by that tag's version
//!   number, which names a reproducible state of the sources and is what a bug
//!   report should quote.
//! * Every other build is a **general** (development) build. There is no
//!   meaningful version number for it, so it is identified by the abbreviated
//!   commit it was built from — plus a note when the working tree had
//!   uncommitted changes, in which case even the commit does not fully
//!   describe the binary.
//!
//! The public functions read what this build recorded; the ones they delegate
//! to take that state as arguments, so every combination can be tested rather
//! than only whichever one the test run happens to have been built in.

/// The version from `Cargo.toml`. On its own this says only which release the
/// sources are *heading for*, which is why an untagged build is identified by
/// its commit instead.
pub const PACKAGE_VERSION: &str = env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION");

/// The git tag HEAD sat on at build time, or empty.
static TAG: &str = env!("BUILD_TAG");
/// The abbreviated commit HEAD pointed at, or empty.
