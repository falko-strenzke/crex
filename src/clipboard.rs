//! Getting bytes into the hex editor from outside: reading the system
//! clipboard, and deciding what pasted data was meant to be.
//!
//! **Reading the clipboard.** A terminal program has no clipboard of its own.
//! Ctrl+V therefore asks whichever helper the desktop provides ([`read`]);
//! where none is installed the editor says so and the terminal's own paste —
//! usually Ctrl+Shift+V, which arrives as a bracketed paste — still works.
//! Both routes end in the same place, so the interpretation below applies
//! however the data arrived.
//!
//! **Interpreting it.** The editor edits hex, but what people have on the
//! clipboard is rarely hex: it may be a base64 blob copied out of a PEM file,
//! or arbitrary bytes. [`hex_digits`] decides between the three readings in
//! the order that keeps each one unambiguous — hex first, because a run of hex
//! digits is also valid base64 and reading `DEADBEEF` as base64 would silently
//! paste something else entirely — and reports which reading it used so the
//! status line can say so rather than leaving the user to spot the difference.

/// How pasted data was read.
